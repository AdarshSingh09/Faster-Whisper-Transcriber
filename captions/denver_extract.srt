1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
and kind of the confluence of this whole idea of the Confluence Week, the merging of two

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,680
rivers.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:13,720
And as we've kind of seen recently in politics and in the world, there's a lot of situations

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,960
where water is very important right now, and it's a very big issue.

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,960
So that is the reason that the back of the logo is considered water.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:38,760
So let me see the creation of the logo here.

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:46,640
So that basically kind of sums up the reason behind the logo and all the meanings behind

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,160
the symbolism.

9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,960
And you'll hear a little bit more about our Confluence Week as basically highlighting all

10
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,760
of these indigenous events and things that are happening around Denver so that we can

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,200
kind of bring more people together and kind of share this whole idea of Indigenous People's

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Day.

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,280
So thank you.

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,320
Thank you so much, and thanks for your leadership.

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,200
All right.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,720
Welcome to the Denver City Council meeting of Monday, October 9th.

17
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,920
Please rise with the Pledge of Allegiance by Councilman Lopez.

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:25,920
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, to the republic for which

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:36,920
it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
All right.

21
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
Thank you, Councilman Lopez.

Eleven members present.

47
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,120
We do have a quorum.

48
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,120
Approval of the minutes.

49
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,960
Are there any corrections to the minutes of October 2nd?

50
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,200
Seeing none.

51
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,880
The minutes of October 2nd stand approved.

52
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,880

53
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:22,560
Are there any announcements by members of council?

54
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,560
Councilman Clark.

55
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
Thank you, Mr. President.

56
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,959
I just wanted to invite everyone down to the first ever Halloween parade on Broadway

57
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:31,600
in Lucky District 7.

58
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,519
It will happen on Saturday, October 21st at 6 o'clock p.m.

59
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,160
It will move along Broadway from 3rd to Alameda.

60
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,600
It's going to be a fun, family-friendly event.

61
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,120
Everyone's invited to come down, wear a costume.

62
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:53,320
There will be candy for the kids and there are tiki zombies and 29 hearses and all

63
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,440
kinds of fun and funky stuff on the fun and funky part of Broadway.

64
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,160
So please join us October 21st at 6 o'clock for the Broadway Halloween parade.

65
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,160
Thank you, Mr. President.

66
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
All right.

67
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,040
Thank you, Councilman Clark.

68
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
I will be there.

69
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
All right.

70
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Presentations.

71
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:11,959
Madam Secretary, do we have any presentations?

72
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:12,959
None, Mr. President.

73
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:13,959
Communications.

74
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:14,959
Do we have any communications?

75
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,320
None, Mr. President.

76
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:23,399
We do have one proclamation this evening, Proclamation 1127, an observance of the

77
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:27,880
annual Indigenous Peoples Day in the City and County of Denver.

78
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,880
Councilman Lopez, will you please read it?

79
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,120
Thank you, Mr. President, with pride.

80
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
Proclamation number 17.

81
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,120
Well, let me just say this differently.

82
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:44,040
Proclamation number 1127, series of 2017, an observance of the second annual Indigenous

83
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,560
Peoples Day in the City and County of Denver.

84
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,720
Whereas the Council of the City and County of Denver recognizes that the Indigenous

85
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,320
Peoples have lived and flourished on the lands known as the Americas since time immemorial

86
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,560
and that Denver and the surrounding communities are built upon the ancestral homelands

87
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,040
of numerous Indigenous tribes, which include the Southern Ute, the Ute Mountain, Ute

88
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,260
of Colorado, and whereas the tribal homelands and seasonal encampments of the Arapaho and

89
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,360
Cheyenne people along the banks of the Cherry Creek and South Platte River confluence

90
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,920
give bearing to the future settlements that would become the birthplace of the Mile

91
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,480
High City.

92
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,920
And whereas Colorado encompasses the ancestral homelands of 48 tribes, and the City and

93
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,480
County of Denver and surrounding communities are home to the descendants of approximately

94
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,860
100 tribal nations.

95
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:42,100
And whereas, on October 3rd, 2016, the City and County of Denver unanimously passed

96
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:48,140
Council Bill 801, series of 2016, officially designating the second Monday of October

97
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:53,980
of each year as Indigenous Peoples Day in Denver, Colorado.

98
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,540
And whereas, the Council of the City and County of Denver continues to recognize and

99
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:07,620
value the vast contributions made to the community through Indigenous people's knowledge, science,

100
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,820
philosophy, arts, and culture, and through these contributions, the City of Denver has

101
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,740
developed and thrived.

102
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,340
Whereas the Indigenous community, especially youth, have made great efforts this year

103
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,420
to draw attention to the contributions of Indigenous people, including Confluence

104
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,700
Drawing record attendance to a national Indigenous youth leadership conference, leading conversations

105
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,180
on inclusion with their peers, and supporting increased Indigenous youth participation in

106
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,500
science and engineering.

107
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,180
Now therefore, be it proclaimed by the Council of the City and County of Denver,

108
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,300
Section 1, that the Council of the City and County of Denver celebrates and honours

109
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,140
the cultural and foundational contributions of Indigenous people to our history, our

110
00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:01,140
past, our present, and future, and continues to promote the education of the Denver community

111
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:07,620
about these historic and contemporary contributions of Indigenous people.

112
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,780
Section 2, that the City and County of Denver, Colorado, does hereby observe October

113
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,219
9, 2017, as Indigenous Peoples Day.

114
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:22,460
Section 3, that the Clerk of the City and County of Denver shall attest and affix

115
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,820
the seal of the City and County of Denver to this proclamation, and that a copy be

116
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:34,140
transmitted to the Denver American Indian Commission, the City and County of Denver

117
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:40,020
School District Number 1, and the Colorado Commission on Indian Affairs.

118
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,140
Thank you, Councilman Lopez.

119
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,140
Your motion to adopt.

120
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:48,220
Mr. President, I move that Proclamation Number 1127, Series of 2017 be adopted.

121
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,660
Alright, it has been moved and seconded.

122
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,020
It comes to the members of Council.

123
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,020
Councilman Lopez.

124
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,380
Thank you, Mr. President.

125
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,180
It gives me a lot of pleasure and pride to read this proclamation officially for the

126
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:09,700
third time, but as Indigenous Peoples Day in Denver officially for the second time.

127
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:15,659
It's always awesome to be able to see not just this proclamation come by my desk,

128
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:23,380
but to see so many different people from our community in our council chambers.

129
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,820
It was a very beautiful piece of artwork that you presented to us earlier, and it

130
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:34,300
is exactly the spirit that we drafted this proclamation and this actual, the ordinance

131
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,500
that created Indigenous Peoples Day when we sat down and wrote it, and as a community,

132
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,900
we couldn't think of anything else to begin except for the confluence of the

133
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,900
two rivers.

134
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,380
And those confluence of the two rivers created such a great city, and we live in such an amazing

135
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:56,300
city and we're all proud of it, and sometimes we, and a lot of people from all over the

136
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,660
country or all over the world are proud of it, and sometimes a little too proud

137
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:07,900
of it is just telling them to go back home, but I'm kidding when I say that.

138
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:13,100
But the really nice thing about this is that we are celebrating Indigenous Peoples

139
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:18,580
Day out of pride for who we are, who we are as a city and the contributions of

140
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:24,140
Indigenous people to the city, not out of spite, not out of a replacement of one

141
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:31,460
culture over the other or out of contempt or disrespect.

142
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:39,100
You know, I think of a quote that Cesar Chavez made very popular, and it stuck

143
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:45,260
with me for a very long time, and anytime I have the opportunity to speak in front

144
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:53,100
of children and especially children in our community that, you know, they often

145
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,140
second-guess themselves on where they're coming from, who they are, and I always

146
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,260
say that, you know, it's very important to be proud of who we are from, and

147
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,380
the quote that I use from Cesar Chavez is, you know, pride in one's own

148
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:12,660
cultures does not require contempt or disrespect of another, right, and that's

149
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,740
very important. It's very important for us to recognize that, no matter who we

150
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:21,220
are, where we come from in this society, that your pride in your own culture

151
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,220
does not require the contempt or disrespect of another, and man, what a

152
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,020
year for that to just sit on our shoulders for a while, for us to

153
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:38,540
think about, right, and so I wanted to just to thank you all. I think the

154
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,420
Commission, there's gonna be a couple individuals that are gonna come speak.

155
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,620
Thank you for your art, your lovely artwork, for us to see what's in your

156
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,620
heart and what now has become a, probably is gonna be a very important

157
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:55,699
symbol for the community, and also just for the work, the daily work

158
00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:59,220
every single day. We still have a lot of brothers and sisters whose

159
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,300
ancestors once lived in these lands freely now stand on street corners, right,

160
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:13,060
in poverty, without access to services, right, without access to sobriety or

161
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:20,380
even housing or jobs, and what a, what a, what a cruel way to pay back a

162
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,020
culture that has paved the way for the city to be built upon its shores,

163
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:30,540
right, so we have a lot of work to do, and these kind of proclamations in this day

164
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,540
is not a day off, it's a day on in Denver, right, and addressing those

165
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:42,180
those critical issues, so I know that my colleagues are very supportive. I'm

166
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,819
gonna ask you to support this proclamation, as I know you always

167
00:10:44,819 --> 00:10:49,420
have done in the past. I'm very proud of today. Oh, and we made Time

168
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,140
Magazine and Newsweek once again today, as being a leader in terms of the cities

169
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,219
that are celebrating Indigenous Peoples Day. I wanted to make a point out of

170
00:10:58,219 --> 00:11:03,780
that. Thank you, Councilman Lopez, and thank you for sponsoring this. Councilman

171
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:07,420
Martega? Mr. President, I want to ask that my name be added. I don't think I

172
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:14,459
could add much more to what Councilman Lopez has shared with us. I want to

173
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:19,020
thank him for bringing this forward, and really just appreciate all the

174
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:25,900
contributions that our Native American community has contributed to this great

175
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,939
city and great state. I worked in the Lieutenant Governor's Office when the

176
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:35,220
Commission on Indian Affairs was created and had the benefit of being

177
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:42,020
able to go down to the Four Corners for a peace treaty signing ceremony

178
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,980
between the Utes and the Comanches that had been sort of at odds with

179
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,820
each other for about a hundred years, and just being able to participate in

180
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:55,860
that powwow was pretty awesome. And for those of you who continue to

181
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,900
participate in the annual powwow, it's such a great opportunity for

182
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,620
everybody else to enjoy so many of the contributions of the culture. I

183
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:11,420
mean, to see that the dance continues to be carried on, as well as the

184
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,140
Native language, from generation to generation is just so incredible,

185
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:22,699
because in so many cultures, you know, people have come here and assimilated to

186
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:29,620
the, you know, the norms here and they lose their language and lose a

187
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:33,780
lot of the culture. And in the Native community, that hasn't happened.

188
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:42,660
That has, that, you know, commitment to just passing that on from generation to

189
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:48,339
generation is so important. And so I'm happy to be a co-sponsor of this

190
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:53,699
tonight. Thank you. All right, thank you, Councilwoman Artega. Councilwoman

191
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:57,500
Kenich. Thank you very much, and I also want to thank my colleague for

192
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:02,100
bringing this forward. And I just wanted to say a word to the artists about how

193
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,020
beautiful and moving I thought this logo was and your description of it. And I

194
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,820
think one of the things that is clear is, you know, the words sometimes don't

195
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,740
convey the power of imagery or music or the other pieces that make up

196
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:20,220
culture, and so I think the art is so important. And when you talked about

197
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,700
water, I was also thinking about land, and I guess I just wanted to say

198
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,940
thank you. Many of the Native American peoples of Colorado have been at the

199
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,980
forefront, or actually nationally, of defending some of the public lands that

200
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,900
have been protected over the last few years that are under attack right now.

201
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:41,180
And they're places that you all, the communities have fought to protect, but

202
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,660
that everyone gets to enjoy. And so I just think that it's an example of

203
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,500
where cultural preservation intersects with environmental protection, with, you

204
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,620
know, recreation and all of the other ways that public lands are so

205
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,420
important. And so I think I just wanted to say thank you for that, because I

206
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,140
think we have some very sacred places in our country that are at risk right

207
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,980
now. And so as we celebrate, I appreciate that there's still a piece

208
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,660
of resistance in here, and I think that I just want to mention a

209
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,780
solidarity, and mention a feeling of solidarity with that resistance. So

210
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:23,260
thank you, and happy Confluence Week. Thank you, Councilman Kenich, and see

211
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:31,380
no other comments. I'll just say a couple. And in a time of such divisive

212
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,740
ugliness and just despicable behavior from our leadership, the reason I'm so

213
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:42,060
supportive of Indigenous Peoples' Day is because it means inclusivity. It

214
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:49,180
means respecting all, respecting those who have been silenced on purpose

215
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,740
for a long time and whose history has not been told. And so we celebrate

216
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,980
inclusivity in the face of such evil times, honestly.
